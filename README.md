Source code for Trimp Studio, a modification of Scratch 1.4.

`Steven.svg` originates from those videos you see on [Zack Bone Productions](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackBoneProductions).

# How to use Trimp (for now)
1. Download the source code
2. Open "TrimpStudio.exe"
3. Enjoy!

Trimp Studio doesn't officially support SqueakJS yet. It will support SqueakJS when there's a way to get the computer's files when clicking "File > Open", or "Import" (in the "Costumes" or "Sounds" sections) in Squeak that can work with SqueakJS.
